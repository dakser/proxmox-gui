"""Redis-backed per-IP sliding-window rate limiter (carryover ME-02).

Relocated from ``app.auth.rate_limit`` and re-implemented on Redis. The Phase-1
limiter held its state in a module-level ``dict``, which is process-local: under
a multi-worker uvicorn each worker had its own bucket, so the effective budget
was ``N × limit`` per IP — a brute-force blind spot (01-REVIEW ME-02). Redis is
a hard dependency since Phase 3 (arq job queue + embedded Redis in the LXC), so
the bucket state now lives there and is shared across every worker process.

Public contract — UNCHANGED from the Phase-1 module so call sites do not move:

- :func:`check_rate(key, *, limit, window)` → ``bool``
- :func:`check_login_rate(ip, *, limit, window)` → ``bool``

Implementation — a sliding-window counter via a Redis **sorted set** keyed by
the rate-limit key, scoring each attempt by its timestamp:

1. ``ZREMRANGEBYSCORE`` evicts entries older than ``window``.
2. ``ZCARD`` counts the survivors.
3. If under ``limit``: ``ZADD`` the current attempt and ``EXPIRE`` the key.

Redis-unavailable fallback (CONTEXT D-19 "acceptable fallback"): when no Redis
is reachable the limiter transparently falls back to a process-local
in-memory sliding window — exactly the Phase-1 behaviour. This keeps the
limiter *functional* (not fail-open) in single-process deployments and tests;
the Redis path is what makes it correct under a multi-worker uvicorn.

Threat mitigations:
- T-01-05-08: brute-force login. 10/60s default per IP, enforced cluster-wide
  via Redis when available, process-locally otherwise.
