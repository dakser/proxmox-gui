"""Pydantic schemas for ``/api/v1/setup``.

The schema layer enforces the input invariants up-front so the service
layer can assume a well-shaped payload:

- ``SetupAdminRequest.username`` matches the project-wide convention
  ``^[a-zA-Z0-9_.-]{3,64}$`` (same regex used by Plan 07's user-admin
  ``UserCreate``). Defense-in-depth — the DB UNIQUE constraint also
  catches duplicates.
- ``SetupAdminRequest.password`` has a 12-char floor matching ASVS V2.1 +
  the project's ``PasswordChangeRequest`` floor from Plan 05.
- ``SetupAdminRequest.email`` uses ``EmailStr`` for RFC-5322 surface
  validation.
