"""Tasks-drawer WebSocket endpoint — ``/api/v1/ws/jobs`` (RESEARCH §Pattern 5).

The client-facing half of the job event pipeline. The *fan-out* half
(``jobs_event_pump`` + ``CONNECTION_MANAGER.broadcast``) was wired in Plan
03-01; this module only adds the endpoint a browser connects to.

Handshake:
  1. Authenticate BEFORE ``accept()`` — resolve the ``access_token`` session
     cookie the same way ``get_current_principal`` does (JWT decode →
     user row). On failure: ``close(code=1008)`` and return — the socket is
     never registered (T-03-02-05).
  2. Resolve the caller's team ids (D-01 — team-wide drawer scope).
  3. ``accept()``, then send a ``{"type":"backfill","jobs":[...]}`` snapshot
     of the recent team-scoped jobs so the drawer renders immediately on
     (re)connect — UI-SPEC §"WebSocket / reconnection contract".
  4. Register the socket with ``CONNECTION_MANAGER`` carrying its team_ids;
     authorization is re-filtered on every push (Pitfall 9 — already done in
     ``events.py``).
  5. Loop on ``receive_text()`` (client keepalive pings) until disconnect,
     then ``CONNECTION_MANAGER.remove`` in a ``finally``.
