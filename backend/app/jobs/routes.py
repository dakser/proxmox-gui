"""Jobs API — ``GET /jobs``, ``GET /jobs/{id}``, ``POST /jobs/{id}/retry``.

All three routes are team-scoped (D-01 — the Tasks drawer is team-wide):
the caller's team set comes from ``_team_ids_for_user``.

- ``GET /jobs`` filters by the caller's teams; out-of-team jobs are simply
  absent.
- ``GET /jobs/{id}`` raises 404 for an out-of-team job — the same response
  shape as not-found (don't-leak-existence, matching the project's
  cross-user-404 convention from Plan 01-05).
- ``POST /jobs/{id}/retry`` re-enqueues only *idempotent* job kinds (D-16);
  ``clone`` / ``migrate`` / ``delete`` / ``restore`` are destructive /
  non-idempotent and are rejected 409. The job must also be in state
  ``failed``.

Route order: the static ``/jobs`` collection path is declared before the
``/jobs/{job_id}`` parameterised path so FastAPI's order-sensitive matcher
resolves them unambiguously.
