"""Redis pub/sub event channel for the Tasks drawer (RESEARCH §Pattern 5).

The worker and the API are separate processes (D-17). Redis is the only shared
channel. The worker ``publish_event``s a small JSON snapshot on every job-state
change; the API runs one ``jobs_event_pump`` subscriber that fans events out to
connected Tasks-drawer WebSockets via the module-level ``CONNECTION_MANAGER``.

Authorization is re-checked on EVERY push (Pitfall 9 / T-03-01-03):
``ConnectionManager.broadcast`` filters each event by the socket's current
``team_ids`` — a job for team B never reaches a socket subscribed for team A.
